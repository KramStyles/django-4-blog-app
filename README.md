## Part II → Creating a Blog Web Application

In this part, I've created a personal weblog Application.
A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVC)

The project has the following features:

1. Login
2. Register
3. Read Blog
4. Create Blog
5. Update Blog
6. Delete Blog

### User Story

1. All Users can be read blogs.
2. Registered Users can create blog post.
3. Blog can only be updated and or deleted by the user who created it or Admin.

### Approach

You can make use of this project by forking or downloading it. You can also clone it.

- Ensure you have python in your system 
- In your terminal after cloning or downloading the project, input and run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- After that, run `python manage.py runserver` or `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Go to your browser and go to the url `http://localhost:5000`
- The link to the hosted version would soon be made available. Thank you
